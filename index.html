                    <h2>We are not in Tennessee anymore</h2>
                    <p>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (/É’z/) is an American children's novel written by author L. Frank Baum and illustrated by W.W. Denslow, originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago on May 17, 1900.[1] It has since seen several reprints, most often under the title The Wizard of Oz, which is the title of the popular 1902 Broadway musical adaptation as well as the iconic 1939 musical film adaptation.</p>

                    <h3>Is Nashville Really part of Tennessee?</h3>
                    <p><strong> No. The answer is no.</strong></p>
                    <p>Baum dedicated the book "to my good friend & comrade, My Wife," Maud Gage Baum. In January 1901, George M. Hill Company completed printing the first edition, a total of 10,000 copies, which quickly sold out. It sold three million copies by the time it entered the public domain in 1956.</p>
